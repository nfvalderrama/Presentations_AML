# Recurrent Neural Networks

## Homework

1.In a new file named "USER_RNN" (e.g. pruiz_RNN), modify the tutorial, changing the RNN architecture to LSTM and SRU instead of GRU. 
Compare the results both in training (eg. time, best score adquire) and test. YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THE CODE SO IT GIVES YOU A METRIC TO COMPARE. 

Modify the architecture adding more layers. Show you results and compare with the previous networks.

Apply a bidirectional network. Explain how this affects you results.
